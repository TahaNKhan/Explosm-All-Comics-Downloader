#  All Cyanide and Happines Comics Downloader
=============================================

## Purpose:
===========
Was reading "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" and ran across a program that downloads all xkcd comics (which had a few bugs in it).
I decided to create one to download all explosm C&H comics. This one works perfectly, downloads all of them unless its a video then it either skips them or downloads the preview image.

## How to Use:
===============
1. Make sure you have python 3.5 installed.
2. Start the 'C&H-All-Comic-Downloader.py' and it'll start downloading the files in /explosm directory.
